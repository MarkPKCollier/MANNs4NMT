# Memory Augmented Neural Networks for Machine Translation

This repository extends the [Tensorflow neural machine translation tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) to create a series of models which apply memory augmented neural networks to machine translation.

This work was conducted as part of my undergraduate final year project at Trinity College Dublin.
